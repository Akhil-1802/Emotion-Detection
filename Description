Model1 and Model2 are the machine learning model on emotion detection.
In Model1 , The dataset is used from kaggle is listed below:

I used Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm for training the model and dumped the file so that I can use the trained model for building webpage.
Accuracy and classification report is listed below:

I used that pickle file in Emotion_Detection.py for building a small webpage , it is not that much accurate as model is not trained for much data , therefore it has less accuracy.
I recommened Model2.py, in which I imported a deepface library which gives me emotion,gender and age of person in the image with precise accuracy.
